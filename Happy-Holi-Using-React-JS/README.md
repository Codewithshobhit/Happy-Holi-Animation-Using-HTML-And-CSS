Hi Everyone ,

I came across @Codewithshobhit's Happy-Holi project on Instagram and was intrigued. Rather than just scrolling past, I decided to delve deeper and explore the source code in your repository. It is really amazing. As I was going through it, I couldn't help but think about the opportunity to incorporate some lesser-used React.js concepts to enhance the project.

After some consideration, I found React.js Higher Order Components (HOC) to be a perfect fit. I believe integrating HOCs into the project could elevate its functionality and structure.

To maintain the integrity of the original codebase, I created a separate folder titled "Happy-Holi-Using-React-JS" and implemented the HOC logic within the app. This way, the existing work remains untouched, while the enhancements are seamlessly integrated.

Below video is the Preview:
